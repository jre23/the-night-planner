## User Story

```
AS a person who wants to avoid covid but still have fun
I WANT an app that suggests recipes and create an evening planner
SO THAT I don't get depressed on my weekends during the pandemic.

GIVEN I'm someone who wants to have fun on the weekend days
WHEN I open this app I have a weekday planner
I am reminded of my evenings tasks and cocktails to make.
```
