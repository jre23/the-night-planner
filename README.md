## User Story

```
AS a person who wants to avoid covid but still have fun
I WANT an app that suggests recipes and create an evening planner
SO THAT I don't get depressed on my weekends during the pandemic.

GIVEN I'm someone who wants to have fun on the weekend days
WHEN I open this app I have a weekday planner
I am reminded of my evenings tasks and cocktails to make.
```


## About the Project

Explore the [Deployed Night Planer](https://suzylebel.github.io/BreakoutRoom_17/)

We’ve all had a moment where no one knows where to eat. The Night Planner has got you covered! Hit the food button for a random food recipe! If you don’t like it, click it again for a new one! Same for cocktail recipes if you’ve really had a long day! Save the recipes you like to the time slots (for meticulous planners) or the notes section so you can view them later!

Process: 
To build this fun little planner we used a few different technologies that includes, JavaScript/Jquery, Web API’s(developers.giphy.com, TheMealDB, TheCocktailDB, moment.js) , Bulma(a css library).

Our plan in the beginning was to divide and conquer the three main API’s between three group members (Joseph, Andrew, and Joel) and have one other group member get the HTML file ready to go (Suzy). Then to get all elements working together we all teamed up on getting everything hooked up to the HTML to get the app working and make it look more put together.

We used Bulma for our CSS framework to style and develop. I also used 


Future Developments: 
-When the User finds a recipe for food and cocktail they will to be able to save that recipe so they can reference it later. 
-Add weather API 
-Create if and else statements in JS to create a greeting based on the time of users day. If it’s 6pm on Thursday: “Time to party!”, but if it’s noon on a Wednesday: “Not time to party yet!”
